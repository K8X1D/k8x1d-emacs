   (description
    "This is a forward compatibility package, which provides (a subset of) the
features of the cl-generic package introduced in Emacs-25, for use on previous
emacsen.  Make sure this is installed *late* in your `load-path`, i.e.  after
Emacs's built-in .../lisp/emacs-lisp directory, so that if/when you upgrade to
Emacsâ‰¥25, the built-in version of the file will take precedence, otherwise you
could get into trouble (although we try to hack our way around the problem in
case it happens).  AFAIK, the main incompatibilities between cl-generic and
EIEIO's defmethod are: - EIEIO does not support multiple dispatch.  We ignore
this difference here and rely on EIEIO to detect and signal the problem. - EIEIOonly supports primary, :before, and :after qualifiers.  We ignore this
difference here and rely on EIEIO to detect and signal the problem. - EIEIO doesnot support specializers other than classes.  We ignore this difference here andrely on EIEIO to detect and signal the problem. - EIEIO uses :static instead of
(subclass <foo>) and :static methods match both class arguments as well as
object argument of that class.  Here we turn (subclass <foo>) into a :static
qualifier and ignore the semantic difference, hoping noone will notice. -
EIEIO's defgeneric does not reset the function.  We ignore this difference and
hope for the best. - EIEIO uses `call-next-method and `next-method-p while
cl-defmethod uses `cl-next-method-p and `cl-call-next-method (simple matter of
renaming).  We handle that by renaming the calls in the `cl-defmethod macro. -
The errors signaled are slightly different.  We make cl-no-applicable-method
into a \"parent\" error of no-method-definition, which should cover the usual
cases. - EIEIO's no-next-method and no-applicable-method have different calling
conventions from cl-generic's.  We don't try to handle this, so just refrain
from trying to call (or add methods to) `cl-no-next-method or
`cl-no-applicable-method'. - EIEIO's `call-next-method and `next-method-p have
dynamic scope whereas cl-generic's `cl-next-method-p and `cl-call-next-method
are lexically scoped.  The cl-defmethod here handles the common subset between
the two.")

   (description
    "Introduction ------------ The basic command to work with subdirectories in dired
is `i', which inserts the subdirectory as a separate listing in the active diredbuffer.  This package defines function `dired-subtree-insert which instead
inserts the subdirectory directly below its line in the original listing, and
indent the listing of subdirectory to resemble a tree-like structure (somewhat
similar to tree(1) except the pretty graphics).  The tree display is somewhat
more intuitive than the default \"flat\" subdirectory manipulation provided by
`i'.  There are several presentation options and faces you can customize to
change the way subtrees are displayed.  You can further remove the unwanted
lines from the subtree by using `k command or some of the built-in \"focusing\"
functions, such as `dired-subtree-only-* (see list below).  If you have the
package `dired-filter', you can additionally filter the subtrees with global or
local filters.  A demo of basic functionality is available on youtube:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z26b8HKFsNE Interactive functions
--------------------- Here's a list of available interactive functions.  You canread more about each one by using the built-in documentation facilities of
emacs.  It is adviced to place bindings for these into a convenient prefix key
map, for example C-, * `dired-subtree-insert * `dired-subtree-remove *
`dired-subtree-toggle * `dired-subtree-cycle * `dired-subtree-revert *
`dired-subtree-narrow * `dired-subtree-up * `dired-subtree-down *
`dired-subtree-next-sibling * `dired-subtree-previous-sibling *
`dired-subtree-beginning * `dired-subtree-end * `dired-subtree-mark-subtree *
`dired-subtree-unmark-subtree * `dired-subtree-only-this-file *
`dired-subtree-only-this-directory If you have package `dired-filter',
additional command `dired-subtree-apply-filter is available.  See
