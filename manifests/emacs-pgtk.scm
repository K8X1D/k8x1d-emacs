`emms-previous', to stop the playback using `emms-stop', and to see what's
currently playing using `emms-show'.  But in itself, this core is useless,
because it doesn't know how to play any tracks --- you need players for this.
In fact, it doesn't even know how to find any tracks to consider playing --- forthis, you need sources.  A sample configuration is offered in emms-setup.el, andthe Friendly Manual in the doc/ directory is both detailed, and kept up to date.")

   (description
    "If you have lots of keybindings set in your init file, it can be hard to know
which ones you haven't set yet, and which may now be overriding some new default
in a new Emacs version.  This module aims to solve that problem.  Bind keys as
follows in your init file: (bind-key \"C-c x\" my-ctrl-c-x-command) If the
keybinding argument is a vector, it is passed straight to `define-key', so
remapping a key with `[remap COMMAND] works as expected: (bind-key [remap
original-ctrl-c-x-command] my-ctrl-c-x-command) If you want the keybinding to
override all minor modes that may also bind the same key, use the `bind-key*
form: (bind-key* \"<C-return>\" other-window) If you want to rebind a key only in
a particular keymap, use: (bind-key \"C-c x\" my-ctrl-c-x-command
some-other-mode-map) To unbind a key within a keymap (for example, to stop your
favorite major mode from changing a binding that you don't want to override
everywhere), use `unbind-key': (unbind-key \"C-c x\" some-other-mode-map) To bind
multiple keys at once, or set up a prefix map, a `bind-keys macro is provided.
It accepts keyword arguments, please see its documentation for a detailed
description.  To add keys into a specific map, use :map argument (bind-keys :map
dired-mode-map (\"o\" .  dired-omit-mode) (\"a\" .  some-custom-dired-function)) To
set up a prefix map, use `:prefix-map and `:prefix arguments (both are required)
(bind-keys :prefix-map my-customize-prefix-map :prefix \"C-c c\" (\"f\" .
customize-face) (\"v\" .  customize-variable)) You can combine all the keywords
together.  Additionally, `:prefix-docstring can be specified to set
documentation of created `:prefix-map variable.  To bind multiple keys in a
`bind-key* way (to be sure that your bindings will not be overridden by other
modes), you may use `bind-keys* macro: (bind-keys* (\"C-o\" .  other-window)
(\"C-M-n\" .  forward-page) (\"C-M-p\" .  backward-page)) After Emacs loads, you can
see a summary of all your personal keybindings currently in effect with this
command: M-x describe-personal-keybindings This display will tell you if you've
overridden a default keybinding, and what the default was.  Also, it will tell
you if the key was rebound after your binding it with `bind-key', and what it
was rebound it to.  See the `use-package info manual for more information.")

    "This is a forward compatibility package, which provides (a subset of) the
features of the cl-generic package introduced in Emacs-25, for use on previous
emacsen.  Make sure this is installed *late* in your `load-path`, i.e.  after
Emacs's built-in .../lisp/emacs-lisp directory, so that if/when you upgrade to
Emacsâ‰¥25, the built-in version of the file will take precedence, otherwise you
could get into trouble (although we try to hack our way around the problem in
case it happens).  AFAIK, the main incompatibilities between cl-generic and
EIEIO's defmethod are: - EIEIO does not support multiple dispatch.  We ignore
this difference here and rely on EIEIO to detect and signal the problem. - EIEIOonly supports primary, :before, and :after qualifiers.  We ignore this
difference here and rely on EIEIO to detect and signal the problem. - EIEIO doesnot support specializers other than classes.  We ignore this difference here andrely on EIEIO to detect and signal the problem. - EIEIO uses :static instead of
(subclass <foo>) and :static methods match both class arguments as well as
object argument of that class.  Here we turn (subclass <foo>) into a :static
qualifier and ignore the semantic difference, hoping noone will notice. -
EIEIO's defgeneric does not reset the function.  We ignore this difference and
hope for the best. - EIEIO uses `call-next-method and `next-method-p while
cl-defmethod uses `cl-next-method-p and `cl-call-next-method (simple matter of
renaming).  We handle that by renaming the calls in the `cl-defmethod macro. -
The errors signaled are slightly different.  We make cl-no-applicable-method
into a \"parent\" error of no-method-definition, which should cover the usual
cases. - EIEIO's no-next-method and no-applicable-method have different calling
conventions from cl-generic's.  We don't try to handle this, so just refrain
from trying to call (or add methods to) `cl-no-next-method or
`cl-no-applicable-method'. - EIEIO's `call-next-method and `next-method-p have
dynamic scope whereas cl-generic's `cl-next-method-p and `cl-call-next-method
are lexically scoped.  The cl-defmethod here handles the common subset between
the two.")

    "Introduction ------------ The basic command to work with subdirectories in dired
is `i', which inserts the subdirectory as a separate listing in the active diredbuffer.  This package defines function `dired-subtree-insert which instead
inserts the subdirectory directly below its line in the original listing, and
indent the listing of subdirectory to resemble a tree-like structure (somewhat
similar to tree(1) except the pretty graphics).  The tree display is somewhat
more intuitive than the default \"flat\" subdirectory manipulation provided by
`i'.  There are several presentation options and faces you can customize to
change the way subtrees are displayed.  You can further remove the unwanted
lines from the subtree by using `k command or some of the built-in \"focusing\"
functions, such as `dired-subtree-only-* (see list below).  If you have the
package `dired-filter', you can additionally filter the subtrees with global or
local filters.  A demo of basic functionality is available on youtube:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z26b8HKFsNE Interactive functions
--------------------- Here's a list of available interactive functions.  You canread more about each one by using the built-in documentation facilities of
emacs.  It is adviced to place bindings for these into a convenient prefix key
map, for example C-, * `dired-subtree-insert * `dired-subtree-remove *
`dired-subtree-toggle * `dired-subtree-cycle * `dired-subtree-revert *
`dired-subtree-narrow * `dired-subtree-up * `dired-subtree-down *

    "This package provides several functions to facilitate a single frame-based
workflow with one workspace per tab, integration with project.el (for
project-based workspaces) and buffer isolation per tab (i.e.  a \"tabspace\"
workspace).  The package assumes project.el and tab-bar.el are both present
(they are built-in to Emacs 27.1+).  This file is not part of GNU Emacs. ;

  (synopsis "Consult integration for Embark")
  (description
   "This package provides integration between Embark and Consult.  The package will
be loaded automatically by Embark.  Some of the functionality here was
previously contained in Embark itself: - Support for consult-buffer, so that you
get the correct actions for each type of entry in consult-buffer's list. -
Support for consult-line, consult-outline, consult-mark and consult-global-mark,
so that the insert and save actions don't include a weird unicode character at
the start of the line, and so you can export from them to an occur buffer (where
occur-edit-mode works!).  Just load this package to get the above functionality,
no further configuration is necessary.  Additionally this package contains some
functionality that has never been in Embark: access to Consult preview from
auto-updating Embark Collect buffer that is associated to an active minibuffer
for a Consult command.  For information on Consult preview, see Consult's info
manual or its readme on GitHub.  If you always want the minor mode enabled
whenever it possible use: (add-hook embark-collect-mode-hook
#'consult-preview-at-point-mode) If you don't want the minor mode automatically
on and prefer to trigger the consult previews manually use this instead:
(keymap-set embark-collect-mode-map \"C-j\" #'consult-preview-at-point)")

   "This package offers a fancy and fast mode-line inspired by minimalism design.
It's integrated into Doom Emacs (https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs) and
Centaur Emacs (https://github.com/seagle0128/.emacs.d).  The doom-modeline
offers: - A match count panel (for anzu, iedit, multiple-cursors,
symbol-overlay, evil-search and evil-substitute) - An indicator for recording a
macro - Current environment version (e.g. python, ruby, go, etc.) in the
major-mode - A customizable mode-line height (see doom-modeline-height) - A
minor modes segment which is compatible with minions - An error/warning count
segment for flymake/flycheck - A workspace number segment for eyebrowse - A
perspective name segment for persp-mode - A window number segment for winum and
window-numbering - An indicator for modal editing state, including evil,
overwrite, god, ryo and xah-fly-keys, etc. - An indicator for battery status -
An indicator for current input method - An indicator for debug state - An
indicator for remote host - An indicator for LSP state with lsp-mode or eglot -
An indicator for github notifications - An indicator for unread emails with
mu4e-alert - An indicator for unread emails with gnus (basically builtin) - An
indicator for irc notifications with circe, rcirc or erc. - An indicator for
buffer position which is compatible with nyan-mode or poke-line - An indicator
for party parrot - An indicator for PDF page number with pdf-tools - An
indicator for markdown/org previews with grip - Truncated file name, file icon,
buffer state and project name in buffer information segment, which is compatible
with project, find-file-in-project and projectile - New mode-line for Info-mode
buffers - New package mode-line for paradox - New mode-line for helm buffers -
New mode-line for git-timemachine buffers Installation: From melpa, `M-x
package-install RET doom-modeline RET`.  In `init.el`, (require doom-modeline)
