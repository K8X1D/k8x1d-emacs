Currently, [[https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/][lsp-mode]] is backend for lsp support. The main reason is that [[https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot][eglot]] and [[https://github.com/manateelazycat/lsp-bridge][lsp-bridge]] doesn't offer the necessary features to support Ltex corretor. Eglot doesn't allow multiserver support, hence latex writing has only access to completion or corrector, not both while Lsp-bridge doesn't support (yet) ltex.

But, those two additional framework are accessible via the ~lsp-framework~ variable ("lsp-bridge"or "eglot").
