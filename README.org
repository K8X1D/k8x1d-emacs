* Emacs 29 on Guix
New features of Emacs 29 looked quite interesting. Sadly, on Guix, only 29.0.50 is available through ~emacs-next~ and ~emacs-next-pgtk~.
The following configuration contains both my testing set-up of emacs and the (awfully written) definition to try emacs 29.0.60.

To set-up non-pgtk version, launch 
#+begin_src 
$ ./set-up_emacs-29
#+end_src

To set-up pgtk version, launch 
#+begin_src 
$ ./set-up_emacs-29-pgtk
#+end_src

Both version can be installed simultaneously.
